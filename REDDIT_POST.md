## Post Body:

Hey everyone,

I've been lurking here for a while and keep seeing the same question come up: **"How much should I charge?"**

I'm thinking about building a dead-simple quote calculator specifically for detailers. Not a full business suite with scheduling, invoicing, CRM, etc. - just a tool that:

- Lets you set your base prices once (by vehicle size + service type)
- Adjusts for condition (light/moderate/heavy)
- Adds on extras (interior, engine bay, wheels, etc.)
- Gives you an instant quote you can share with the customer

The idea is you pull it up on your phone, tap a few options, and show them a professional-looking price on the spot. No more awkward "uhh let me think..." moments.

**My questions for you:**

1. Would something like this actually help your business?
2. What would make it a "must-have" vs "nice-to-have"?
3. If it saved you time and made you look more professional, what would you pay? ($5/mo? $10/mo? Nothing because you'd never pay for this?)

I've put up a quick landing page at [detailquote.vercel.app] if you want to see what I'm thinking. Not asking for money or signups - just trying to figure out if this is worth building.

Appreciate any feedback, even if it's "this is dumb, don't bother."

## Posting Tips:

1. **Timing**: Post on Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm EST (peak activity)
2. **Flair**: Use "Discussion" or "Business" flair if available
3. **Engagement**: Reply to every comment within first 2 hours
4. **Don't be salesy**: Focus on getting feedback, not promoting
5. **Be genuine**: Admit you're exploring the idea, not selling

## What to track:

- [ ] Upvote ratio (>80% is good signal)
- [ ] Number of comments (10+ is good engagement)
- [ ] Positive vs negative sentiment
- [ ] Specific feature requests
- [ ] Price sensitivity signals
- [ ] "I'd use this" vs "meh" responses
- [ ] Waitlist signups (check Neon dashboard)

## Red flags to watch for:

- "I already use X for this" → Research that tool
- "This is free with [software]" → Validate the gap still exists
- "I just use a spreadsheet" → Opportunity or entrenched behavior?
- Many downvotes with few comments → Wrong audience or bad timing

## Follow-up post (if validation passes):

After 50 waitlist signups, post an update:

> "Thanks for the feedback on my quote calculator idea - I built it! Here's what the first 50 detailers told me they needed..."
